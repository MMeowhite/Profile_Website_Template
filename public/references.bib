  abstract={Background:Liver metastasis is a major cause of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Understanding how CRC cells influence the formation of hepatic premetastatic niches (PMNs) is crucial for developing targeted therapies. Objective:We aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism by which extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from CRC cells with high liver metastatic capacity facilitate the formation of hepatic PMNs. Design:CRC cells with high metastatic potential were selected using a liver metastasis mouse model through two rounds of splenic injections. The role of EVs secreted by CRC cells in the liver was investigated using lipidomics and single-cell sequencing. Clinical significance was evaluated by tumour samples from patients with CRC. Results:EVs derived from highly metastatic CRC cells facilitate the formation of PMNs by driving hepatic lipid accumulation. The upregulation of fatty acid (FA) synthesis in CRC cells leads to significantly increased levels of prosteatogenic lipids in EVs, promoting hepatic lipid accumulation. Inhibition of hepatic lipid accumulation reduces the prometastatic capability of EVs secreted by highly metastatic CRC cells. Moreover, EVs are primarily taken up by Kupffer cells, where they induce tumour necrosis factor alpha secretion, further driving hepatic lipid accumulation. In patients with late-stage CRC, CRC cells exhibit elevated FA synthesis, which contributes to hepatic lipid accumulation. Notably, suppressing FA synthesis in CRC patient-derived organoids alleviates hepatic lipid accumulation and reduces liver metastasis. Conclusion: Inhibition of FA synthesis in CRC cells with high metastatic potential reduces hepatic lipid accumulation and subsequent metastasis, highlighting a new strategy for preventing liver metastasis.},

  abstract={Cancer cells with stemness characteristics effectively escape the recognition and killing of immune-active cells, such as T cells, which has been considered as the root cause of cancer recurrence and metastasis. To sensitize cancer immunotherapy, we have developed salinomycin-repurposed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress nanoinducers (DTSS NPs) to synergistically suppress cancer cell stemness. Salinomycin, as a polyether antibiotic demonstrating robust cytotoxicity against tumor stem cell, is co-assembled with thymopentin (TP5) and ER-targeted phototherapeutic agent s-780, and tailored with DSPE-PEG-biotin to obtain DTSS NPs. This nanoplatform not only improves the bioavailability of TP5 and salinomycin, but also ensures controlled drug release and reduces the side effects of therapeutic agents. Moreover, the hyperpyrexia and ROS produced by s-780 further induced ER stress, which downregulates PD-L1 expression and activates the cGAS-STING pathway, while TP5 significantly promotes the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes, resulting in the augment of the anti-tumor immunity. Importantly, salomycin synergistically boosted s-780-mediated ER stress to effectively inhibit the stemness of cancer cells, thereby enhancing the responsiveness of cancer cells to T cells. As expected, DTSS NPs activate systemic immunity and suppress cancer metastasis and recurrence, providing promising solutions for sensitizing cancer immunotherapy by inhibiting cancer cell stemness.},

  abstract={Antigen processing and presentation are fundamental for connecting innate and adaptive immune responses in combating cancers and infections. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), serving as second messengers in various physiological processes, play a vital role in modulating antigen processing and presentation. However, oxidative stress due to an imbalance characterized by excessive accumulation of ROS or inadequate antioxidant defenses can severely impair antigen-specific immune responses, contributing to the pathophysiology of multiple health conditions, notably including various cancers, cancer-associated infections and autoimmune diseases. This review comprehensively investigates the multifaceted effects of ROS on antigen processing and presentation, encompassing immunopeptide generation, the functionality of antigen-presentation machinery (APM), and the interactions of antigen-presenting cells and antigen-specific effector cells. It emphasizes the critical pathophysiological roles of oxidative stress in diseases such as cancers, cancer-associated infections and autoimmune diseases. Moreover, we delve into the therapeutic potential of targeting redox homeostasis to enhance antitumor immune responses. By illuminating the intricate interplay between ROS and immune functionality, this review provides an essential theoretical framework for developing innovative immunotherapy strategies aimed at restoring immune competency and improving clinical outcomes in patients with immune-related diseases.},

  abstract={The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) plays a critical role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, and its dysregulation has been linked to depression. In this study, we explored the function of the inhibitory NMDAR subunit GluN3A in depression using chronic restraint stress (CRS) and GluN3A knockout (KO) mouse models. We found that hippocampal GluN3A expression was significantly decreased in CRS-induced depressive mice, and viral re-expression of GluN3A alleviated depression-like behaviors. Conversely, GluN3A deficiency induced anhedonia and behavioral despair, accompanied by downregulation of synapse- and axon-related genes and a reduction in the postsynaptic protein PSD95, as revealed by RNA-seq and molecular analyses. Importantly, PSD95 loss in CRS mice was rescued by viral-mediated GluN3A re-expression. These findings indicate that GluN3A dysfunction contributes to depressive phenotypes through synaptic deficits, providing new insights into inhibitory NMDAR signaling and potential therapeutic targets for depression.},
