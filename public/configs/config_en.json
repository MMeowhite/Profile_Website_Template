In this study, we examined GluN3A expression in a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model of depression and explored its molecular mechanisms. We found that GluN3A expression was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of CRS mice, and restoring GluN3A expression alleviated depression-like behaviors. Furthermore, GluN3A knockout (KO) mice exhibited symptoms of anhedonia and despair, alongside downregulation of genes involved in synapse and axon development. Reduced PSD95 levels in GluN3A KO mice were rescued by viral re-expression of GluN3A, highlighting its crucial role in regulating synaptic function and depression-related behaviors. Despite these findings, the full mechanism by which GluN3A contributes to depression remains unclear.",
