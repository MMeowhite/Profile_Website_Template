​	In todays blog, I will make a depth profiling of the classical article "***β2 Adrenergic-Neurotrophin Feedforward Loop Promotes Pancreatic Cancer***" published  in ***《Cancer Cell》*** by [Timothy C.Wang](https://timothycwanglab.org/), leading expert in gastroenterology cancer research and patient care. It demonstrated the the β2 adrenergic neurotrophin oversecrection, abnormal level of the epinephrine and norepinephrine, stimulated by stress will promote pancreatic cancer iniation, development and progreesion. The graphical abstract of this article was catched in blow picture:

​	Furthrmore, the downstream molecules NGF or BDNF, not other neurotrophin such as GDNF, was digged out under stress condition and its effect leads to axonogenesis through Trk receptors (NGF-BDNF/Trk pathways) and further increased adrenergic input into the tumor microenvironment to form positive feedforward loop. The highlight of the research is the disease model construction. Here, I simplely list the disease model utilized in this article:

- Animal Disease Model
  - Environmal mouse model: Chronic Restraint Stress (CRS) mice;
  - Genetic mouse model: $\text{LSL-Kras}^{\text{+/G12D}};\text{Pdx1-Cre(KC)}$ mice, $\text{LSL-Kras}^{\text{+/G12D}};\text{LSL-Trp53}^{\text{+/R172H}};\text{Pdx1-Cre(KPC)}$ mice, ADRB2 knockout mice;
  - Surgical mouse model: Bilateral Adrenalectomy(ADx) mice;
  - Drug interruption mouse model: mice injected veinously by ICI118,551(selective β2-adrenergic receptor blocker), Isoproterenol(ISO, adrenergic receptor agonoist), atenolol(selective β1-adrenergic receptor blocker), propranolol(non-selective β2-adrenergic receptor blocker).

In addition, the oganoids derived from pancreatic cancer patient also was performed and validate the view.

​	In summary, this study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) highlights the critical role of nerves in cancer development. Specifically, the research demonstrates the significant impact of systemic stress and elevated catecholamine levels during the early stages of PDAC progression. The findings suggest that targeting ADRB2 and/or Trk receptors could serve as a promising preventive or therapeutic approach for PDAC, a malignancy for which more effective treatments are urgently needed.

## 1 Background

The section provides some basic and necessary research background and intention about this article.

### 1.1 The Initiation and Poor Progonsis of PDAC

​	The initiation of PDAC have been investigated for many years. A recent review article outline the pancreatic cancer putative cells of origin. Anatomically, The pancreatic cell was divided into two types: **acinar cells** and **ductal cells** according to cell morphology. In early development stage, oncogene mutation and tumor suppressor loss such as KRAS,TP53 drives the precursor lesions of pancreatic tissue from low level to high level. Eventually, The PDAC was formed and classified into three types: classical, basal-like and hybrid types accoding to origin of cancer cells.

​	The reason why average prognosis of PDAC patient is 5 years extremly confused clinical doctor and research scientist. It drives so many groups to explore the underlying reseaon.

Up to date, some pointview have been proposed and validated:

- **Late Diagnosis**: PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, typically when the cancer has already spread beyond the pancreas to other organs.
- **Lack of Early Detection Methods**: There are no effective screening tools for PDAC, and current diagnostic methods, like imaging or biopsy, may miss early-stage tumors.
- **Aggressive Nature of the Disease**: PDAC is characterized by rapid growth and early metastasis.
- **Poor Response to Treatment**: PDAC is notoriously resistant to conventional therapies like chemotherapy and radiation.
- **Limited Surgical Options**: The majority of PDAC patients are not candidates for surgery because the tumor has already spread or is located in an inoperable part of the pancreas.

Ongoing research into early detection, targeted therapies, and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment are crucial to improving survival outcomes. For this target, many scientist fous on the PDAC.



### 1.2 The New Interdiscipline of Cancer and Neuroscience: Cancer Neuroscience

​	In recent decades, interdiscipline research made great success in many research field includes the cross of cancer diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment and neuroscience. The research timeline can be traced to late 19th century:

### 1.3 The Cancer Neuroscience in PDAC

​	Cancer neuroscience in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) examines how the nervous system influences tumor development, progression, and patient symptoms. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments for this aggressive cancer.

#### 1.3.1 Key Aspects of Cancer Neuroscience in PDAC

​	The first key aspects of cancer neuroscience is remarkable and notable phenomenon that spread of cancer cells along the nerves named **Perineural Invasion (PNI)**. Here, the arrow show PNI node composed by neural sheats

<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/590c8acf6b8f5bfe3f3c44da/1595541143863-BYX5NP6IH553D6SDM8HB/PNI.jpg?format=1500w" alt="PNI"/>

The concept was initially proposed by Drapiewski *et al* and proved in proliferative breaset disease. More than a century ago and was regarded as the fifth route of cancer spread, in addition to the four well-known ways: direct invasion to surrounding tissues, lymphatic metastasis, hematogenous metastasis, and seeding along body cavities. Since then, PNI has been identified in various malignancies, including head and neck cancers, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer. PDAC often exhibits perineural invasion, where cancer cells invade nerves, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. This interaction between nerves and cancer cells is a significant factor in PDAC progression.

​	Due to it's unique anatomical positioning, sensory nerves, particularly those releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), play a role in PDAC called **Sensory Nerve Involvement**. Elevated CGRP levels are associated with increased cancer pain and tumor progression. Studies have shown that reducing CGRP+ sensory neurons can impede disease progression and alleviate pain. This is primary reason that extreme cancer pain often attacked in late or Late stage highly malignant PDAC patients. The latest research about the uncover the [characterization of single neurons reprogrammed by pancreatic cancer show the neurons enrichments](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08735-3) in PDAC pancreas compare to normal organ by PRPH stain method:

<img src="./assets/PDAC_PRPH stained_pancreas.png" alt="PDAC PRPH stained pancreas" height="200px" width="auto"/>

​	In addition, **Neuroplastic changes** occur, including increased expression of pancreatic neurotrophic factors and sensory innervation in early PDAC development. These changes may contribute to tumorigenesis and offer potential targets for therapy. In todays research article share, we will observe that the oversecreted catecholamines promote PDAC initiation and progression under chronic stress restraint.

​	**Mathematical Modeling** have been developed to simulate nerve-tumor interactions in PDAC. These models help understand how different types of axons (sympathetic or sensory) influence tumor progression and can guide therapeutic strategies targeting the nervous system.	

Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments for this aggressive cancer.

#### 1.3.2 Implications for Treatment

Understanding the role of the nervous system in PDAC opens avenues for novel therapeutic approaches:

- **Targeting Nerve-Cancer Interactions:** Interventions that disrupt the communication between nerves and cancer cells could slow tumor growth and alleviate pain.

- **Modulating Sensory Nerve Activity:** Controlling the activity of sensory nerves, particularly those releasing CGRP, may reduce cancer-related pain and inhibit tumor progression.
- **Utilizing Mathematical Models:** Computational models can predict the effects of nerve-targeted therapies, aiding in the design of clinical trials and personalized treatment plans.



​	In summary, integrating cancer neuroscience into PDAC research enhances our understanding of tumor biology and opens new therapeutic possibilities by targeting the complex interactions between the nervous system and cancer cells.

## Results

### Chronic Neuropsychological Stress Promotes Kras-Induced Pancreatic Tumorigenesis, which is regulated by ADRB2

​	The begining of the story is from the finding that **upregulated the level of epinephrine** and **higher sroces of PanINs** in CRS mice model (mice treated by chronic restraint stress in 14 weeks, 6 hr/day - 5 days/week). Because of the upregulated epinephrine and β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) is reported to be the major mediator for chronic-stress-induced cancers, including PDAC, the authors investigated the effects of ADRB2 in stressed or unstressed mice by receptor agonist(ISO injection), receptor antagonist(ICI injection), ADRB2 knouck-out, bilateral adrenalectomy(ADx). The pathogical pancreatic H&E images demonstrated the disoganization of the pancreas and recoveried morph change i

Subsequently, quantitative measurement of ADRB family genes includes ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRB3 were performed. The qPCR outcomes indicated the ADRB2 is higher expression in KC mice and validated in ADRB2 IHC in these mouse.

​	In the next step, the authors infer that whether percentage of neural components secreting Epi is cosistent with observation above. The peripherin IHC was tested:

<img src="./assets/peripherin_IHC.png" alt="QQ_1740016786826" style="zoom:25%;" />

The statistical ratio pattern of peripherin by IHC stain is consistent with incidence of PDAC.

​	Taken together, The authors summary the observation that these results suggest that **chronic stress and increased circulating catecholamines lead to an expansion of intrapancreatic nerves.** But we still don't know the reason why upregulation of ADRB2 expression and neuron density in PDAC sample contribute to transition from early stage PanIN to late stage PanIN.

### ADRB2 Blockade Significantly Increases Overall Survival in KPC Mice

​	To further verify the ADRB2 Blockage effects in **spontaneous PDAC model**, authros utilized the **LSL-*Kras*^+/LSL-G12D^;LSL-*Trp53*^+/R172H^;*Pdx1*-Cre (KPC) model**, which develops early PanIN lesions at 7–9 weeks of age, advanced PanIN lesions at 13–15 weeks, and PDAC by 17–19 weeks. The authors design the same experiment(H&E stain, IHC stain, qPCR) to prove the significant neural invasion in the KPC mice model.

<img src="./assets/KPC_HE_IHC.png" alt="QQ_1740031831389" style="zoom:25%;" />

The H&E images and statistics(Nerve number, Peripherin), qPCR gene quantity demonstrate the similar morphylogical and gene change in KPC mice. 

​	While the **Peripherin** is an intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in the **peripheral nervous system**, especially in **sensory neurons**, **motor neurons**, and some **sympathetic neurons**, it is not clear the sensory neurons or motor neurons contribute the efforts. So, the authors use the TH^+^ antibody to stain sympathetic neurons selectively to analyse the whether the sympathetic outputs is enlarge. 

<img src="./assets/TH_IHC_KPC.png" alt="QQ_1740033696811" style="zoom:25%;" />

Labelling sympathetic neurons with TH^+^ antibody have the same representation and statistics in contrast to peripherin distribution pattern.

The pancreatic ADRB2 IHC and qPCR in PDAC from KPC mice was carried out in various treatment group. As expected, ADRB2 is upregulated because of negative feedback regulation of receptors and distributes within ductal cells in PDAC tissue.

<img src="./assets/ADRB2_treatment.png" alt="QQ_1740043518416" style="zoom:25%;" />

For poor prognosis of pancreas of PDAC also be improved in some extent in treatment of ICI and ganglionectomy(Gx).

<img src="./assets/prognosis_improvement.png" alt="QQ_1740043814821" style="zoom:25%;" />

Targeting for inhibiting sympathetic nervous input to tumor significantly increased overall survival and decreased tumor volume, in consistent with reduced neuron density without histopathologic change.
