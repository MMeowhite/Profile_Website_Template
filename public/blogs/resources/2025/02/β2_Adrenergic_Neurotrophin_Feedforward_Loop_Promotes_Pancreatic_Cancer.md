​	In todays blog, I will share the classical article "***β2 Adrenergic-Neurotrophin Feedforward Loop Promotes Pancreatic Cancer***" published by [Timothy C.Wang](https://timothycwanglab.org/), leading expert in gastroenterology cancer research and patient care. It demonstrated the the β2 adrenergic neurotrophin oversecrection, abnormal level of the epinephrine and norepinephrine, stimulated by stress will promote pancreatic cancer iniation, development and progreesion. The graphical abstract of this article was catched in blow picture:

​	Furthrmore, the downstream molecules NGF or BDNF, not other neurotrophin such as GDNF, was digged out under stress condition and its effect leads to axonogenesis through Trk receptors (NGF-BDNF/Trk pathways) and further increased adrenergic input into the tumor microenvironment to form positive feedforward loop. The highlight of the research is the disease model construction. Here, I simplely list the disease model utilized in this article:

- Animal Disease Model
  - Environmal mouse model: Chronic Restraint Stress (CRS) mice;
  - Genetic mouse model: $\text{LSL-Kras}^{\text{+/G12D}};\text{Pdx1-Cre(KC)}$ mice, ADRB2 knockout mice;
  - Surgical mouse model: Bilateral Adrenalectomy(ADx) mice;
  - Drug interruption mouse model: mice injected veinously by ICI118551(selective β2-adrenergic receptor blocker), Isoproterenol(ISO, adrenergic receptor agonoist), atenolol(selective β1-adrenergic receptor blocker), propranolol(non-selective β2-adrenergic receptor blocker).

In addition, the oganoids derived from pancreatic cancer patient also was performed and validate the view.

​	In summary, this study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) highlights the critical role of nerves in cancer development. Specifically, the research demonstrates the significant impact of systemic stress and elevated catecholamine levels during the early stages of PDAC progression. The findings suggest that targeting ADRB2 and/or Trk receptors could serve as a promising preventive or therapeutic approach for PDAC, a malignancy for which more effective treatments are urgently needed.

## 1 Background

The section provides some basic and necessary research background and intention about this article.

### 1.1 The Poor Progonsis of PDAC

​	The reason why average prognosis of PDAC patient is 5 years extremly confused clinical doctor and research scientist. It drives so many groups to explore the underlying reseaon. 

<img src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2524/8493373/70f7b47113e2/ajcr0011-4294-f1.jpg" alt="poor prognosis of PDAC" height="300px"/>

Up to date, some pointview have been proposed and validated:

- **Late Diagnosis**: PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, typically when the cancer has already spread beyond the pancreas to other organs.
- **Lack of Early Detection Methods**: There are no effective screening tools for PDAC, and current diagnostic methods, like imaging or biopsy, may miss early-stage tumors.
- **Aggressive Nature of the Disease**: PDAC is characterized by rapid growth and early metastasis.
- **Poor Response to Treatment**: PDAC is notoriously resistant to conventional therapies like chemotherapy and radiation.
- **Limited Surgical Options**: The majority of PDAC patients are not candidates for surgery because the tumor has already spread or is located in an inoperable part of the pancreas.

Ongoing research into early detection, targeted therapies, and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment are crucial to improving survival outcomes. For this target, many scientist fous on the PDAC.



### 1.2 The New Interdiscipline of Cancer and Neuroscience: Cancer Neuroscience

​	In recent decades, interdiscipline research made great success in many research field includes the cross of cancer diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment and neuroscience. The research timeline can be traced to late 19th century:

Here, I also summary some key research finding and developments:

- **Early Foundations (1900s - 1970s)**:
  - **Initial Discovery of Cancer and Nervous System Interactions**:
    - Early studies began to hint at connections between the nervous system and cancer. However, research was fragmented and primarily focused on cancer biology and the nervous system separately.
    - **1920s-1930s**: Early neurobiological studies on how tumors might affect neural tissues or cause symptoms in patients, such as paraneoplastic syndromes.

- **Cancer Neurobiology (1980s - 1990s)**:
  - **Recognition of Tumor-Intrinsic Neural Interactions**:
    - **1980s**: Emerging interest in the role of the nervous system in tumor growth, especially through neurochemicals like neurotransmitters and hormones. Studies started linking the central nervous system (CNS) and cancer progression.
    - **1990s**: Research began focusing on how neurotrophic factors (like NGF, BDNF) could affect cancer cell behavior. Some studies showed that cancer cells could exploit the nervous system’s signaling mechanisms for metastasis.

- **Neurogenesis and Cancer (2000s)**:
  - **Growing Understanding of Cancer’s Effects on the Nervous System**:
    - **2000s**: Studies started to show how tumors could influence the brain and nervous system via neural networks, causing pain, cachexia, and cognitive dysfunction. Understanding of how tumors can induce changes in neural function and structure grew.
    - Development of models investigating the role of **neuroinflammation** in cancer progression and metastasis, especially in relation to brain metastases.

- **Neuro-oncology Emerges as a Specialty (2010s)**:
  - **Rise of Cancer Neuroscience**:
    - **2010s**: Neuro-oncology emerged as an interdisciplinary field, combining cancer research with neuroscience to understand how the nervous system influences cancer, and vice versa.
    - **Neuroinflammation and Tumor Growth**: Increased focus on the impact of inflammatory responses in the CNS, the blood-brain barrier, and cancer metastasis to the brain. Neuroinflammation became recognized as a significant contributor to cancer progression, including glioblastomas.
    - **Cancer Pain Research**: The role of the nervous system in modulating cancer pain, particularly in conditions like pancreatic cancer or metastatic bone disease, received more attention.

- **Current Trends and Future Directions (2020s and beyond)**:
  - **Cancer Neuroscience and Immune Therapy**:
    - **Targeting Neural Mechanisms in Cancer Treatment**: Recent studies are exploring how targeting neurotrophic factors, neural signaling pathways, or neural-immune interactions can enhance cancer treatments.
    - **Personalized Medicine and Neuroscientific Advances**: Advances in precision medicine have encouraged the development of targeted therapies that account for neural-tumor interactions. Additionally, research into how cancer treatment may affect the brain (e.g., chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline) has grown.
    - **Cancer-Related Cognitive Dysfunction**: More attention is being paid to the neurocognitive effects of cancer treatment, particularly after chemotherapy (commonly referred to as "chemo brain").



### 1.3 The Cancer Neuroscience in PDAC

​	Cancer neuroscience in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) examines how the nervous system influences tumor development, progression, and patient symptoms. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments for this aggressive cancer.

#### 1.3.1 Key Aspects of Cancer Neuroscience in PDAC

​	The first key aspects of cancer neuroscience is remarkable and notable phenomenon that spread of cancer cells along the nerves named **Perineural Invasion (PNI)**. Here, the arrow show PNI node composed by neural sheats

<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/590c8acf6b8f5bfe3f3c44da/1595541143863-BYX5NP6IH553D6SDM8HB/PNI.jpg?format=1500w" alt="PNI"/>

The concept was initially proposed by Drapiewski *et al* and proved in proliferative breaset disease. More than a century ago and was regarded as the fifth route of cancer spread, in addition to the four well-known ways: direct invasion to surrounding tissues, lymphatic metastasis, hematogenous metastasis, and seeding along body cavities. Since then, PNI has been identified in various malignancies, including head and neck cancers, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer. PDAC often exhibits perineural invasion, where cancer cells invade nerves, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. This interaction between nerves and cancer cells is a significant factor in PDAC progression.

​	Due to it's unique anatomical positioning, sensory nerves, particularly those releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), play a role in PDAC called **Sensory Nerve Involvement**. Elevated CGRP levels are associated with increased cancer pain and tumor progression. Studies have shown that reducing CGRP+ sensory neurons can impede disease progression and alleviate pain. This is primary reason that extreme cancer pain often attacked in late or Late stage highly malignant PDAC patients. The latest research about the uncover the [characterization of single neurons reprogrammed by pancreatic cancer show the neurons enrichments](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08735-3) in PDAC pancreas compare to normal organ by PRPH stain method:

​	In addition, **Neuroplastic changes** occur, including increased expression of pancreatic neurotrophic factors and sensory innervation in early PDAC development. These changes may contribute to tumorigenesis and offer potential targets for therapy. In todays research article share, we will observe that the oversecreted catecholamines promote PDAC initiation and progression under chronic stress restraint.

​	**Mathematical Modeling** have been developed to simulate nerve-tumor interactions in PDAC. These models help understand how different types of axons (sympathetic or sensory) influence tumor progression and can guide therapeutic strategies targeting the nervous system.	

Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments for this aggressive cancer.

#### 1.3.2 Implications for Treatment

Understanding the role of the nervous system in PDAC opens avenues for novel therapeutic approaches:

- **Targeting Nerve-Cancer Interactions:** Interventions that disrupt the communication between nerves and cancer cells could slow tumor growth and alleviate pain.

- **Modulating Sensory Nerve Activity:** Controlling the activity of sensory nerves, particularly those releasing CGRP, may reduce cancer-related pain and inhibit tumor progression.
- **Utilizing Mathematical Models:** Computational models can predict the effects of nerve-targeted therapies, aiding in the design of clinical trials and personalized treatment plans.



​	In summary, integrating cancer neuroscience into PDAC research enhances our understanding of tumor biology and opens new therapeutic possibilities by targeting the complex interactions between the nervous system and cancer cells.
